The *configuration_examples* section of the **Finite State Machine** repository contains examples showing how to configure the FSM using different tools provided by ST. 

The purpose of these examples is not the final application (dedicated [application examples](../application_examples/) are provided for final applications).  The focus is on the process to configure the FSM, following all the FSM configuration steps.
