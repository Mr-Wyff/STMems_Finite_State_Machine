## 1 - Introduction

This Finite State Machine (FSM) example implements *tilt detection*, used to trigger an event when the inclination between the x-axis and the horizontal plane exceeds a specified angle.

The FSM processes data coming from the accelerometer, configured at 26 Hz and 2 g.

The tilt angle is configurable, the default is -30 degrees (-0.5 g on the x-axis).


## 2 - Device orientation

The device must be placed with the x-y plane parallel to gravity. At 0 degrees of tilt the y-axis is pointing up.


## 3 - Finite State Machine output values

None.


## 4 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when a *tilt* of the specified angle is detected.
